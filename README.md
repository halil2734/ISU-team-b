## Important Notes

-use a meaningful Name for classes.

-give your section a class Name and when styling any element inside the section, put the class name of that section
       
         """""""""""""""e.g""""""""""""""  
                    <section class="home">
                        <h1>
                        ISU
                        </h1>
                        </section>


                    The style will be like this:
                    
                        .home h1{
                                value: property;
                            }
        """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
-make a new branch for every single and put commits for every important feature

-give a meaningful commit messages to your commit

-push your branch before merge

-ask questions on whatsapp

-For font Family we will go with "Lato" not the same from the image but we can't change it later.
